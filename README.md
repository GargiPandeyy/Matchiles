A spooky-themed memory card matching game built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

I made this because of two main reasons : i) I want to create somthing on Halloween
ii) I want to improve my memory 

I have added ghost mode and haunted mode which are somewhat spooky.

During this game, I had to revise the Web Audio API - creating sound effects programmatically using oscillators 

and gain nodes was completely new to me, and I spent hours debugging why sounds weren't playing correctly. 

The 3D CSS card flip animations using `perspective` and `rotateY` transforms required understanding how 3D transforms work, 

which was tricky at first. Managing multiple game states, timers, and intervals simultaneously while keeping everything synchronized 

was also really challenging - I had to learn how to properly clear intervals and handle async operations. Implementing LocalStorage 

for the high score leaderboard taught me about data persistence, and getting the particle effects and special game modes to work smoothly 

pushed me to think more carefully about event timing and DOM manipulation. 

Overall, it was a great learning experience that helped me understand how to build more complex interactive web applications.
